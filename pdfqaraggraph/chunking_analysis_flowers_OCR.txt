==================================================

📋 DOCUMENT OVERVIEW
--------------------
📄 Content Type: Academic Paper
📊 Total Characters: 113,831
📝 Total Words: 14,237
📑 Paragraphs: 91
🏗️ Structure Score: 0.45/1.00 (Moderately structured)
📏 Average Paragraph Length: 1249 characters
📐 Average Sentence Length: 480 characters

🔎 KEY FINDINGS
---------------
📚 Academic content detected - requires balanced chunks to preserve context while maintaining searchability
🔧 Moderately structured document - standard chunking approach recommended
📏 Long paragraphs detected - chunk size increased to avoid mid-paragraph splits

🎯 RECOMMENDED CONFIGURATION
------------------------------
📦 Chunk Size: 1248 characters
🔄 Overlap: 187 characters (15.0%)
⭐ Confidence Score: 60/100

💡 WHY THIS CONFIGURATION:
   • Large chunks (1248 chars) chosen to preserve context and narrative flow
   • Moderate overlap (15.0%) to ensure important information isn't lost at boundaries

📈 EXPECTED RESULTS:
   • Estimated chunks: ~91
   • Storage efficiency: 6.7x redundancy factor
   • Best for: narrative understanding, context-heavy applications

🔄 ALTERNATIVE CONFIGURATIONS
------------------------------
1. Chunk Size: 1248, Overlap: 249 (20.0%) - Score: 60
   Use when: you need higher precision with more focused chunks

2. Chunk Size: 1248, Overlap: 312 (25.0%) - Score: 60
   Use when: you prioritize storage efficiency over overlap

3. Chunk Size: 1560, Overlap: 234 (15.0%) - Score: 60
   Use when: you need maximum context preservation


🚀 IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE
-------------------------
Sample LangChain configuration:

```python
from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter

text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(
    chunk_size=1248,
    chunk_overlap=187,
    length_function=len,
)
```

📋 TESTING RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Start with the recommended configuration
2. Test with your specific queries
3. Monitor retrieval quality metrics
4. Adjust based on actual performance

⚠️ CONSIDERATIONS:
• Embedding model context window: Ensure 1248 chars fit your model
• Storage costs: Higher overlap = more storage required
• Query types: Adjust chunk size based on expected question complexity
